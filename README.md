# Flowchart Generator
Because manual labor is for losers


## FAQ

#### Why was this created?
My AP Computer Science teacher told us one day to create a flowgraph
using different code samples given to us for practice, and drawing a
flowgraph by hand is a lot of work... Therefore...

Automation solves all problems

#### How do I use this?
You don't. It's mine. You can draw your flowcharts manually for
all I care

#### How does it work?
Linked lists. A bunch of linked lists.

#### Did you create all this yourself?
Of course not. Everyone knows that to become a better programmer,
all you have to do is to steal other people's work

All the parsing of the source code into a syntax tree was done by
[very smart people](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter) who are
much better at programming than me

#### Why is the output a XML file?
Currently the generator draws the flowchart using mxGraph, which you can
render [here](https://draw.io)

#### Why are all of the edges drawn in odd positions?
Because I'm too lazy to find the best connection route myself, so fix
that yourself manually

#### Why does the first node say it's an ending node?
Because trying to detect if an EndpointNode represents the first or
last node is a lot of extra work for something that can be fixed
manually in a few seconds. Do it yourself, lazyass
